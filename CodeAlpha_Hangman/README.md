Advanced console-based Hangman game developed in Python as part of CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. The game uses predefined words, allows limited attempts, validates user input, and follows clean and modular coding practices.

# Hangman Game – Python

This project is an advanced console-based Hangman game developed using Python as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.

## Project Description
The Hangman game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of five words. The player must guess the word one letter at a time within a maximum of six incorrect attempts. The game provides real-time feedback, validates user input, and handles repeated guesses efficiently.

## Features
- Random word selection using Python's random module
- Case-insensitive user input
- Input validation (single alphabet only)
- Detection of repeated guesses
- Limited incorrect attempts (6)
- Win and lose conditions
- Clean and modular code using functions

## Concepts Used
- Python functions
- While loop
- If-else conditions
- Lists and strings
- Random module
- Basic error handling

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the following command:
   $$ python Hangman.py
